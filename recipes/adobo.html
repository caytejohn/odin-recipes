    <h2>What is Chicken Adobo</h2>
    <p><strong>Chicken Adobo</strong> is a Filipino dish made by braising chicken legs (thighs and/or drumsticks) in a sauce made up of vinegar, soy sauce,
      garlic, and black pepper.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients for Chicken Adobo</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 (3 pound) chicken, cut into pieces</li>
      <li>1 large onion, quartered and sliced</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
      <li>⅓ cup white vinegar</li>
      <li>⅔ cup low sodium soy sauce</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons black pepper</li>
      <li>1 bay leaf</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions on making Chicken Adobo</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook chicken pieces until golden brown on both sides, then remove. Stir in the onion
        and garlic; cook until they soften and brown, about 6 minutes.</li>
      <li>Pour in vinegar and soy sauce, and season with garlic powder, black pepper, and bay leaf. Add the browned chicken, increase the heat to high, and
        bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the chicken is tender and cooked through, 35 to 40 minutes.</li>
